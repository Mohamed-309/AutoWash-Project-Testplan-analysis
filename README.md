# AutoWash-Project-Testplan-analysis
A 3D graph generated by matplotlib and numpy that models the results of our school project which aims to decrease the water pollution that is generated by the industrial field; furthermore, reuse the wasted water generated by the food factories in order to decrease the water consumption
The graph has been generated based on the 3 test plans that we have made; moreover, generating random test plans (random library) and accumulated results based on our real results.
